4. Here you can select your minecraft version as well as the `Loader Version`. The Loader should always be set to the newest version, some bugs may occur on old versions. `Create Profile` will automatically create a new profile in your Minecraft launcher.
5. Open your Minecraft launcher, a new profile should've been added to your account

### Installing Fabric mods
1. Download the mods you want. If you are here for Tool Assisted Speedrunning, you can head to [downloads]({{<ref "/downloads/">}})  
**All mods have to match the Minecraft version you want to play in. Mods for 1.17 don't work on 1.18!**
2. Go to the `.minecraft/` directory
3. Put the .jar files in the `mods/` folder. If there is no folder, create one and name it `mods/`
4. Start Minecraft from the launcher
