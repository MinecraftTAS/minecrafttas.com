      <description>Non-playback TASing The basics Instead of choosing each input per frame and play back the TAS at the end, non-playback TASing is the act of screen recording yourself speedrunning, but setting the game to slow motion.
Later in video editing, you speed up the footage from slow motion to normal speed.
The result is a video in normal speed, but the player has better rection times.
Additionally you may use savestates, which is the ability to create a restore point at any time during your run and if you fail at something, you can reload the savestate to try again.</description>
